This could all be done with a telnet client on a Windows box as well.

nc google.com 80
HEAD / HTTP/1.0

Why did I do version 1.0 instead of 1.1.?

nc google.com 80
HEAD / HTTP/1.0

nc google.com 80
OPTIONS / HTTP/1.0

nc challenge_server 80
OPTIONS / HTTP/1.0

nc google.com 80
GET / HTTP/1.0

nc google.com 80
GET /search?q=kali HTTP/1.0

nc duckduckgo.com 80
GET /?q=kali&format=json HTTP/1.0

nc duckduckgo.com 80 > search-results
GET /q=ctf&format=json HTTP/1.0
